Driver for fpga IP bus_led -> armadeus/firmware/led/
Fabien Marteau <fabien.marteau@armadeus.com>

To use it configure fpga with bus_led then insert led.ko with insmod :
>insmod led.ko

watch dmesg :
LED: MAJOR: 253 MINOR: 0
Led module insered

then make a character file with wright major and minor number :
>mknod led c 253 0

Then led can be switched on/off writing a character in nod file, 
only LSB will switch led, 1 will switch off led and 0 will 
witch on. To read value, just read the file.
