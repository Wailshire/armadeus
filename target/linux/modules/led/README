Driver for fpga IP bus_led -> armadeus/firmware/led/
Fabien Marteau <fabien.marteau@armadeus.com>

To use it configure fpga with bus_led then insert led.ko with insmod :
>insmod led.ko

Watch dmesg :
LED: MAJOR: 253 MINOR: 0
Led module inserted

Then make a character file with wright major and minor number :
>mknod led c 253 0

Then led can be switched on/off writing a character in node file, 
only LSB will switch led, 1 will switch off led and 0 will 
witch on. To read value, just read the file.

To test read/write testled.c can be used, to compile :
make test
then launch the binary :
>./testled led

Sysfs is created at /sys/fpgaled/status, to print the led status:
>cat /sys/fpgaled/status
To switch the status :
>echo 1 > /sys/fpgaled/status
