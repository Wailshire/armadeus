 You can change the music directory and take for instance /mnt/mmc to play your SD card on your apf
 by changing MUSIC_DIR var in player.c before compilation or by executing the player with the repertory
 you want to read in arg: for instance, #./aplayer /mnt/mmc
 /!\ Try to limit pathnames' carateres.
