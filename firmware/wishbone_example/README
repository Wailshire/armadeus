This project is an exemple for wishbone interface . There are three Wb slaves :

* irq_mngr : this slave joins irq from others wishbone IP and
						 send it to i.mx processor.To manage these irq
						 two registers are available :
						 		irq_mask ( addr : 0x0000)        : enable irq writing 1
						 		irq_pend/irq_ack (addr : 0x0002) : writing 1 acknowledge irq
						 																			 and reading 1 inform that an irq pending.
						This design use one irq for button push and release.

* Wb_led   : a simple led register, one led is branched on register LSB.
						 To switch on led write '0' on led register. Address register
						 is :
						 		LED (addr : 0x0004)
* Wb_button: Simple button register, when button is pressed, register LSB
						 is '0', and when it's release LSB is '1'. On each switching
						 an interuption is send to irq_mngr.
						 		button (addr : 0x0008)
