Simple design to blink a led from the i.mx.

1) Description

Led is branched on fpga P116 with this schematics :

          3.3v

FPGA16 -----	
(P116)

See ucf file in sr/bus_led.ucf for more details 
NET "LED"     LOC = "P116"  | IOSTANDARD = LVCMOS33 ;     

To change the value from uboot use mw.w command and write
on address 0x12000000 :
mw.w 12000000 0001 1 # led off
mw.w 12000000 0000 1 # led on

2) Simulation 

The testbench is in testbench/ directory using apf_test_pkg.vhd in
apf_pkg/ directory, to simulate it you can use ghdl using the makefile.
compile:
>make ghdl-compil

run (the end of test finish with assert error "end of test"):
>make ghdl-run

And see graph result with gtkwave:
>make ghdl-view

3) Synthesis

To synthetize the design, you need Xilinx webpack installed correctly
and you can use make:
>make
This will make synthesis, place & route and bitgen, and will copy the
bitstream in /tftpboot/ directory

4) Configure

To configure, you need tftpboot installed on your computer, and on 
uboot type:
>tftpboot 08000000 bus_led_top.bit
>fpga load 0 08000000 1ffd5
